Coding (Game Development) is a very intriguing thing to learn about. Some of the things I have learned in coding has helped me slowly develop my own game. But while that is in the works, there is two games that I would like to review that have very interesting codes, and how they change every time you play. Those two games will be Undertale and Lost In Vivo.

This game is poked fun at a lot, either because of the fanbase, or the humor of the game. But a thing not a lot of people talk about is the coding in the game. This games code changes EVERY time you play. These codes enable different things to happen in the game that totally affect the story. Different dialogue, new enemies, secret rooms, you name it. The actual visible code for the game isn’t visible (yet) but the values in the notepad file is visible. The games code was leaked onto GitHub by an anonymous user pretending to be the creator of the game, Toby Fox. The GitHub repository was taken down by DMCA. But here is the funny part; Toby did not use any coding language for the game, he used Game Maker Studio12, but you can see part of the code in the games folder. Each time you reset the game, the code changes and gives you new story or new rooms. Personally, I think that is very cool, and that is one of the reasons why I enjoy Undertale.

Lost In Vivo is a game I have been playing for a few weeks. Much like Undertale, the code is not available, but I will be talking about the drastic changes the game can make, in only seconds. 

This game is a survival-horror game, and you play as a man who tries to find his dog after it got washed up into the sewers. The game itself messes with your head in many ways, as it tries to freak you out. One “save” room in the game doesn’t save your save, but it deletes it. Or does it? This is just one of the examples of what the game does. During the playthrough, you may walk by some regular walls and think nothing of it, and then go to a dead end that is very close to that wall. Suddenly, the second you turn around, there is a door to a new room. There is also one part in the game where you need to adjust head statues to open a door, but when you turn around and look at the door, and then look back where the heads were, they secretly adjusted themselves to a new angle. It is a very good game and it messes with you in more ways than just that.

Now, I don’t have the brain power to even begin to comprehend the type of coding behind both of these games, I can for sure say that the coding in these games were worked on for a while, changing things not even seconds after you look at it. But these games are both masterfully created and deserve more attention, mainly Lost In Vivo. So if you ever have the time and money to play the game, I would totally recommend giving it a shot.
